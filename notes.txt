implement lobbies
implement helicopter or something simple for one player
Use basegame class


























To implement game lobbies and game sessions in your multiplayer Python gaming application, you can follow these steps:

Create a Lobby class that will represent a game lobby. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

lobby_id: A unique identifier for the lobby.
players: A list of players connected to the lobby.
game_session: A reference to the game session associated with the lobby.
add_player(): A method to add a player to the lobby.
remove_player(): A method to remove a player from the lobby.
start_game(): A method to start the game session when the lobby is full or a condition is met.
Create a GameSession class that represents an ongoing game. The class should have the following attributes and methods:

session_id: A unique identifier for the game session.
players: A list of players in the game session.
game_state: An object representing the current state of the game.
update_game_state(): A method to update the game state based on player actions.
broadcast_game_state(): A method to send the updated game state to all connected players.
Modify the server.py file to handle lobby and game session management:

Add a list of lobbies.
Implement methods to create and manage lobbies and game sessions.
Add logic to the player() function to handle game-specific messages and pass them to the appropriate game session.
Modify the player() function to support lobby and game session management.
Modify the client.py and associated files to handle the lobby and game session UI:

Add a new screen for displaying available lobbies and creating new ones.
Implement UI components to display game sessions and their states.
Modify the client's main loop to handle game-specific messages and update the game state accordingly.
Some other major improvements you could consider are:

Refactor your code by splitting large files into smaller, more manageable modules. For example, the server.py file contains many responsibilities, like handling connections, authentication, and chat. You could separate these responsibilities into different modules.

Implement unit tests to ensure that your code behaves as expected, especially when making significant changes like adding game lobbies and game sessions.

Use a more robust database solution, like PostgreSQL or MySQL, instead of SQLite for better performance and scalability.

Use a more mature networking library, like Twisted or asyncio, for better performance and easier management of asynchronous tasks.

Add support for secure connections using TLS/SSL to protect user data and communication between the server and clients.
